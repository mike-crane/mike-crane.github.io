Pair programming is exactly exactly as its name would suggest, two programmers working together on the same task. Often referred to as collaborative programming,  developers work alongside one another while sharing a workstation. Several benefits have been linked to the practice, while its critics argue that its effectiveness isnâ€™t that much greater than that of the traditional means of programming. [1]
	The age old argument that two heads are better than one holds true for the vast majority of subjects, programming being no exception. While the programmers go about completing their task, one assumes the role as the driver while and the other as the navigator, they will frequently switch roles. Doing do, they are able to divide responsibilities allowing for more focus of their attention on the task at hand. The benefits can be seen in everything from team communication and satisfaction to simple economics and design quality. [2]
